# SpaceInvaders: An Android game app built in Java.
- To test the game:
    - Clone this project
    - Open in Android Studio, select an emulator or your Android device, then hit Run.

## To do:
1. The scale of objects (player ship, invaders) and the speed work fine with several emulators in Android Studio. However, when it runs on an actual Android device, the scale is off.
2. Put different levels into different Activities so that it will be easier to test. One class should handle one problem only. Currently, only level 1 works. Need to add Level2Activity, Level3Activity
